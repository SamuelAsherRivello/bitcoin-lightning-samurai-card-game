# Implementation Plan: DebugHUD

**Branch**: `003-debug-hud` | **Date**: 2026-05-09 | **Spec**: `specs/003-debug-hud/spec.md`
**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/003-debug-hud/spec.md`

## Summary

Add a reviewer-facing DebugHUD to the Bevy card inspection prototype. The implementation keeps the HUD contained in the Bevy runtime ECS modules, shows one translucent top-left panel by default, exposes `F` and `I` diagnostic toggles, leaves `WASD` as visible non-functional legend labels, and excludes toast, minimap, reticle, movement, shooting, health, score, and other gameplay HUD behavior.

## Technical Context

| Item | Decision |
| ---- | -------- |
| Language/Version | Rust 2024 workspace |
| Primary Dependencies | Bevy 0.18.1, bevy-inspector-egui 0.36.0 |
| Storage | N/A |
| Testing | `scripts/other/RunTests.ps1` runs `cargo test --workspace` |
| Target Platform | Windows desktop now; browser WebGPU remains a required final verification target |
| Project Type | Bevy ECS desktop/browser game prototype |
| Performance Goals | HUD update is lightweight and frame-local; FPS text is sampled on a 0.5 second interval |
| Constraints | Keep reusable DebugHUD, inspector, and diagnostic input behavior under `bevy/crates/shared`; keep scripts under `scripts/`; no gameplay HUD systems |
| Scale/Scope | One HUD panel, one FPS toggle, one inspector toggle, automated tests for creation and input behavior |

## Constitution Check

| Gate | Status | Notes |
| ---- | ------ | ----- |
| Active spec and repo guidance followed | ✅ | Implementation follows `003-debug-hud` and repo-local AGENTS guidance |
| Source, scripts, and tests stay in approved locations | ✅ | Reusable DebugHUD runtime code is under `bevy/crates/shared`; game app code under `bevy/crates/game` only composes it |
| Visible feedback requirements respected | ✅ | DebugHUD is visible by default; no unrelated loading/toast systems added |
| Browser/local storage constraints | ✅ | No storage, SQLite, OPFS, or browser-only state added |
| Real behavior verification path | ✅ | Desktop build and tests use repository scripts; browser WebGPU verification is documented in quickstart |
| Rust and Bevy ECS standards | ✅ | State is represented with components, resources, systems, and plugins |
| Target parity risk documented | ✅ | Desktop is verified in this iteration; browser WebGPU must be verified separately if toolchain is unavailable |

    └── StopApp.ps1          # Stops running project app/build processes
```

**Structure Decision**: Keep DebugHUD, inspector, and diagnostic input capture in `bevy/crates/shared` because they are reusable system-level diagnostics. `bevy/crates/game` should only compose the shared diagnostics with card-specific systems. Do not add a separate UI framework, gameplay subsystem, asset pipeline, or persistence layer for this feature.

## Complexity Tracking

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
| --------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------ |
| N/A | N/A | N/A |

## Phase 0 Research

See `specs/003-debug-hud/research.md`.

## Phase 1 Design

See `specs/003-debug-hud/data-model.md`, `specs/003-debug-hud/contracts/debughud-ui.md`, and `specs/003-debug-hud/quickstart.md`.

## Post-Design Constitution Check

| Gate | Status | Notes |
| ---- | ------ | ----- |
| No unresolved clarifications | ✅ | Spec clarifications define HUD content, `F`/`I`, and non-functional `WASD` |
| No target-specific code introduced | ✅ | Bevy UI and input APIs are shared across desktop and browser targets |
| Verification documented | ✅ | Tests, desktop build/run, and browser WebGPU verification commands are documented |
